shoot(phi,xspan,lval,lder,rval,rder,init)

Use the shooting method to solve a two-point boundary value problem.
The ODE is u'' = `phi`(x,u,u') for x in `xspan`. Specify a function
value or derivative at the left endpoint using `lval` and `lder`,
respectively, and similarly for the right endpoint  using `rval` and
`rder`. (Use an empty array to denote an unknown quantity.) The
value `init` is an initial guess for whichever value is missing at
the left endpoint.

Returns vectors for the nodes, the values of u, and the values of
u'.
